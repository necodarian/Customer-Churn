This is my final project on Customer churn. Combine the report and jupyter file for a better understanding of the work.

Introduction:

Customer churn is when a customer leaves a company entirely. Customer
churn is a good indicator of the number of clients a company loses over a
given period. Customer churn analysis is vital for many companies as it helps
them to understand and be able to predict which of the customers is likely to
leave because it costs more to acquire new customers than to maintain
existing ones. Thus, retaining loyal customers for years makes it much easier
to grow and weather financial hardship than spending money to acquire new
customers to replace those who have left. Also, successful customer retention
increases the customer’s average lifetime value, making all future sales more
valuable and improving unit margins. In this analysis, you will answer some
business questions and perform a predictive analysis of the bank customer
churn dataset to help the bank management make informative business
decisions.

Data:
The dataset contains several explanatory variables used to assess customer
churn, including customer ID, credit score, location, gender, age, tenure, bank
balance, credit cards, status (active or not), complaints, satisfaction scores,
exited or not, etc. You can find the dataset file and complete description of the
variables on the course page. A sample of the original data is provided for you
for your analysis. The sample records are divided into two files Main
Sample and New Sample.

Description of Tasks:

Task A:

• Knowing some statistics about the churn dataset can help to
improve the banking business. Thus, analyse the dataset provided
in the Main Sample file to answer the following business questions.

i. What is the proportion of the customers that are still using the
banking services compared to those that have left in the period
covered in the dataset? Is there a significant difference in the
proportion that the bank authority should be worried about?

ii. What is the relationship between the number of complaints
received by the bank authorities and the number of exited
customers?

iii. What are the characteristics and statistics (in terms of gender,
age groups, and tenure etc,) of the customers that are more
likely to complain? Provide an informative profile description of
those type of customers.

iv. Is there a significant difference between the credit scores of all
the customers that have complained and those who have not in
the period covered in the dataset?

v. Do the satisfaction scores on complain resolution provide
indication of the customers’ likelihood of exiting the bank?

vi. The bank has a reward system where the customers earn points
when they use their Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Platinum bank
card. Determine if there is a significant difference in the average
points earned by the different groups of customers.


Task B:

• Develop a model to predict whether a customer will complain or not
given the historical customer records in the Main Sample file.
Evaluate the developed model using appropriate metrics and report
its performances accordingly. Remember to also discuss the
implications of the performance (error or accuracy) of the model
with respect to the banking business.

Task C:

• Once your model is finalised, use it to predict whether the bank
customers included in New Sample file, will complain about the
banking services based on their profile information in the dataset.
Tabulate the predicated results in your report, in the order the
records are arranged in the file. This will be compared with the
expected outcomes for assessing the goodness of your model.
